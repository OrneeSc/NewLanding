My personal Web as Frontend Developer
(last movements - january 2024)

how to up the proyect:
1. npm install
2. npm run start

The objetive of this code was playing with my differents skills of FE developer and get my own domain.
On different occasions I enter into the project and correct code and update things that are old.
This project, like others, is a way to be active with the code and not lose practice and knowledge.
I hope you like it and I listen to opinions.
